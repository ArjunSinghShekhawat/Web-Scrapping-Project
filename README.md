In this Python project, we aim to scrape phone reviews, comments, ratings, and additional information from Flipkart using the Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries. With these powerful tools, we can automate the process of extracting valuable insights from the platform's vast array of user-generated content.

Beautiful Soup facilitates the parsing of HTML and XML documents, enabling us to navigate through the structure of Flipkart's web pages effortlessly. The Requests library allows us to send HTTP requests to Flipkart's servers, retrieving the necessary data for analysis.

Our script will begin by sending a request to the Flipkart website, targeting the desired phone's review section. Upon receiving the HTML response, Beautiful Soup will step in to extract relevant tags containing review text, user comments, and ratings. We'll then parse and organize this data into a structured format for further analysis.
